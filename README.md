DESCRIPTION:
As part of Task 1 of my internship, I was asked to create a professional and creative logo for the fictional brand "CodTech." Using Figma as the primary design tool, I developed three different logo variations that each reflect a modern and tech-oriented identity. Figma was ideal for this task because it provides a browser-based, collaborative interface with precise vector editing tools, alignment features, shape controls, and easy export options. I began by creating a blank Figma canvas and setting up a grid structure to maintain alignment and symmetry across all logo versions. I chose the Poppins typeface for the main text, which is a clean, rounded sans-serif font commonly used in tech startups and digital brands due to its readability and modern feel. Each of the three logo variations was built using geometric shapes like circles, rectangles, and triangles, with thoughtful arrangement to convey a sense of structure and simplicity.

In the first variation, I focused on combining the initial "C" of CodTech into a compact and stylized logomark using a circular base with a triangular arrow emerging from the center. This represented both the idea of motion (symbolizing innovation) and direction (pointing toward growth or progress). I kept the color scheme monochromatic with black and gray tones for clarity, professionalism, and contrast. The second variation was a monogram logo, where the "C" and "T" were merged using bold line strokes and corner rounding to form a unified visual element. This version was designed to be scalable and minimal, ideal for favicon icons or mobile apps. In the third variation, I created a text-based logo by customizing the “CodTech” wordmark. I adjusted the kerning (spacing between characters), used different weights to distinguish "Cod" and "Tech", and introduced a small circular dot at the end to serve as a subtle identity symbol.

To ensure real-world usability, I placed each logo variant on both white and dark backgrounds to test their legibility and balance. I also created sample placements such as in a navbar, mobile icon, and header section by designing simple mockups directly in Figma. This helped visualize how each version would look in practical contexts. The entire file was structured using groups and auto-layouts, making it easy to manage and present. All three logos were exported in SVG and PNG formats to ensure scalability and transparency support.

Throughout this task, I learned how to think like a brand designer — focusing not just on visual appeal but also on flexibility, scalability, and clarity. I also practiced working with Figma's shape tools, alignment guides, color swatches, and typography controls. This task helped me understand how important spacing, consistency, and simplicity are in logo design. Overall, this assignment sharpened my visual design skills, improved my comfort with vector tools, and gave me the confidence to create real-world branding assets in a structured design environment.
